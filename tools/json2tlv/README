JSON to TLV
-----------

json2tlv is a utility for converting a JSON file containing an array of flow records
to the TLV format (implemented in nDPI). This tool is able to serialize and export 
TLV records over ZMQ. This is meant to be used for functional and performance tests.

Example with json2tlv reading a JSON file with flows and generating TLV records in a
loop to a local instance of ntopng:

# json2tlv -i flows.json -z tcp://*:5556c -E 10000

# ntopng -i tcp://127.0.0.1:5556
